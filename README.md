An interactive and teachable visual assistant

SecondEye is an interactive and teachable visual assistant. It can be used for a variety of vision-related tasks and use cases. It can also be taught to perform personalized vision tasks without training or programming. All in an interactive and iterative manner.

SecondEye can only be built currently with Gemini because of the following modelâ€™s unique capabilities:
    1. Object detection with the ability to return accurate bounding-box positions
    2. Native video support with the ability to return time-stamped information
    3. Large context window
